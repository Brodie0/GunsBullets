# Lines starting with the # character are comments. Empty lines are ignored.
#
# First line should be the map's width and height, followed by H lines with
# W ints each. Objects you can place: "0" which is nothing, "1" which is a
# wall and "2" being an ammo crate. These tokens are defined in Map.cs.
